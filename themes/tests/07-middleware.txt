MIDDLEWARE
==========

That's a middleware to choose the current theme and set it to the current request.

For that, it uses a function set in settings, so the developer can set it as he/she wants,
based on criteria he/she needs.

    >>> from django.test.client import Client
    >>> cl = Client()

    >>> from themes.models import ThemeTemplate, Theme

    >>> theme = Theme.objects.get(is_default=True)
    >>> home = theme.templates.create(name='home', content='Just testing this home page.')

    >>> resp = cl.get('/')
